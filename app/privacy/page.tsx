            <p>
              We collect only what we need to run the platform. We don&apos;t sell your data. We don&apos;t use your data to train AI. We keep it secure. And you can ask us to delete it anytime.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-white">1. What we collect — and why</h3>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Account information</strong><br/>
              Your name, email, and password when you sign up. We need this to create and manage your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Usage data</strong><br/>
              How you use Aivory — which features you use, how often, where you click. We use this to improve the platform and fix what&apos;s broken.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Content you create</strong><br/>
              Your assessments, blueprints, workflows, and agent configurations. We store this so you can access and use it. It stays yours.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Payment information</strong><br/>
              Processed securely through our payment provider. We never see or store your full card details.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Communications</strong><br/>
              If you contact us by email or chat, we keep a record to help us respond and improve our support.

          <section className="space-y-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-white">2. What we don&apos;t do with your data</h3>
            <p>
              We don&apos;t sell it. Ever.<br/>
              We don&apos;t share it with advertisers.<br/>
              We don&apos;t use it to train AI models — ours or anyone else&apos;s.<br/>
              We don&apos;t hand it to governments unless legally required, and we&apos;ll tell you when that happens if we legally can.

          <section className="space-y-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-white">3. Who we share data with</h3>
            <p>
              We work with a small number of trusted service providers to run Aivory — cloud infrastructure, payment processing, email delivery, analytics. They only get what they need to do their job, and they&apos;re bound by the same data protection standards we are.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don&apos;t share your data with anyone else without your explicit consent.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-white">4. How we keep your data safe</h3>
            <p>
              Encryption in transit and at rest. Access controls so only the right people inside Aivory can see what they need to. Regular security reviews. And a clear process for responding if something goes wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there&apos;s ever a data breach that affects you, we&apos;ll notify you within 72 hours.
            </p>

          <section className="space-y-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-white">5. How long we keep your data</h3>
            <p>
              As long as your account is active. After you cancel, we keep your data for 30 days so you can export anything you need — then it&apos;s permanently deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some data — like payment records — we&apos;re legally required to keep longer. We&apos;ll hold the minimum necessary and no more.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-white">6. Your rights</h3>
            <p>
              Regardless of where you&apos;re based, we believe everyone deserves the same basic rights over their personal data:

              <li>Delete your account and all associated data</li>
              <li>Withdraw consent for data processing at any time</li>
              <li>Opt out of non-essential communications anytime</li>
